# Actions version scanning

This tool assists GitHub workflow mantainers into enumeration and update of GitHub Actions versioning. Referencing GitHub Actions versions by release tag or commit is considered a better practice than using the 'latest' tag: it allows consistency in your supply chain and avoids uncontrolled changes from open source repositories.
